I am currently an [IAS Early Career Fellow](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/ias/about/community){:target="\_blank"} working with [Gareth Alexander](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/galexander/){:target="\_blank"} at the Centre for Complexity Science, University of Warwick. From March 2020 I will be a [postdoc in the Souslov Lab](https://people.bath.ac.uk/as3764/authors/jack/) at the University of Bath.

My research interests are in theoretical soft matter physics, with a focus on geometry, topology and nonequilibrium systems. I defended my PhD thesis, ["Construction and Dynamics of Knotted Fields in Soft Matter Systems"](https://github.com/jackbinysh/Thesis){:target="\_blank"} in 2019. Before that, I graduated with an MPhys from the University of Oxford.
