I am a [IAS Early Career Fellow](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/ias/about/community){:target="\_blank"} working with [Gareth Alexander](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/galexander/){:target="\_blank"} at the Centre for Complexity Science, University of Warwick.  

My research interests are in theoretical soft matter physics, with a focus on geometry, topology and nonequilibrium systems. I defended my PhD thesis, ["Construction and Dynamics of Knotted Fields in Soft Matter Systems"](https://github.com/jackbinysh/Thesis){:target="\_blank"} in 2019. 


<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
